# AutoFIB-Code-Generator
This script will generate many lines of code compatible with FEI FIB 200 AutoFIB NT software
This script is designed to use tkInter to allow users to select a shape and stage movements to allow tecilation of patterns using autofib to complete structures over a large array.

As it is right now, The codes greates strength is milling multiple arrays of identical structuresoperating th stages course motion.

Great resources for learning more about AutoFIB are the FEI user manuals

There are two components to an AutoFIB script:
1)A pattern file
2)An Autofib script.

Autofib scripts are capable of 
-loading multiple pattern files
- Coarse stage motion
- Beam shifts
- current changes
- much more
